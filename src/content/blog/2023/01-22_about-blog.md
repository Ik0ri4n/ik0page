A little under a year ago, I started my journey into the riddles and joys of cybersecurity by joining [KITCTF](https://kitctf.de).
(We're not yet organized officially so "joining" is quite the open term.
But since I have actively participated in many events with them the past half of a year I guess it is fair to say so.)
Starting out, I had little knowledge of anything involved in CTFs but my interest kept me going nonetheless and I learned a lot already in such a short time.
This blog is the result of me wanting to share my experience and make my knowledge accessible to others.

## Focus of this blog

Growing from my CTF experience, this blog will mainly feature cybersecurity topics, especially writeups of challenges I solved or liked a lot.
I am currently focussing my studies on reverse engineering to get going but intend to widen this focus later.
The blog will also contain future works or CVEs in this field should I write or discover any.
Depending on time and motivation, I might also cover broader topics concerning computer science and development.
As such, you can consider this blog as both a diary or log of my personal experiences as well as a growing study of the mentioned topics.

Continuing my studies at the KIT I cannot guarantee any fixed schedule.
However, it does make more sense to me anyway to write about something relevant and interesting whenever it occurs than to force out content where there is none.
Anyways, I do still intend to write a post every now and then.

## Feedback

This blog is intended as an open project and I would very much enjoy your feedback.
It will start out without comments but I will probably add that once I find the time to implement it.
The whole project is available at GitHub however and you can always open an issue if you have any questions, feedback or improvements.

I am no seasoned web developer and this project does also work as an opportunity for me to try out new technologies.
Of course, I do my best to provide an interesting and accessible experience for everone.
That being said, I cannot avoid all such problems without any experience as of yet and will prioritize any accessibility issues should they arise.
